### Usage Instructions
You'll only need your blog's address and deployment credentials. 
- Enter blog's address in the format `yoursite.azurewebsites.net`(even if you have a custom domain for your website, do use the azurewebsites.net one).
- Enter your deployment credentials. They are not the username/password pair used to log into the Azure Management Portal. You can, however, set them comfortably in the Azure Management Portal. Please open your website's dashboard and click on 'Reset Deployment Credentials' in the 'Quick Links' area if you don't know or remember your credentials.
