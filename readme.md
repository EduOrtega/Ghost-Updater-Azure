# Ghost Updater for Microsoft Azure [WIP]
While Microsoft Azure allows a one-click installation of the popular blogging platform Ghost, Ghost currently does not offer a automatic upgrade function. This is tool automatic upgrades Ghost running in Azure Websites. It's available as a standalone version for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

## Usage Instructions
Download the Ghost Updater for Azure for Windows, OS X or Linux and open the application. You'll only need your blog's address as well as deployment credentials. 
- Your blog's address in the format `yoursite.azurewebsites.net`(even if you have a custom domain for your website, do use the azurewebsites.net one).
- Deployment credentials are not the username/password pair used to log into the Azure Management Portal. You can, however, set them comfortably in the Azure Management Portal. Please open your website's dashboard and click on 'Reset Deployment Credentials' in the 'Quick Links' area.
