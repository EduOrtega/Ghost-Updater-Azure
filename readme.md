# Ghost Updater for Microsoft Azure
Microsoft Azure allows a one-click installation of the popular blogging platform Ghost, but there's currently no integrated update option. This tool automatically upgrades Ghost running on Azure Websites. It's been developed by the Microsoft DX team and upgrades Ghost installations with just a few clicks!

## Download
- [Windows](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/Ghost-Updater-Azure/releases/download/v0.5.1/GhostUpdater-0.5.1-windows.zip)

## Usage Instructions
You'll only need your blog's address and deployment credentials. 
- Your blog's address in the format `yoursite.azurewebsites.net`(even if you have a custom domain for your website, do use the azurewebsites.net one).
- Deployment credentials are not the username/password pair used to log into the Azure Management Portal. You can, however, set them comfortably in the Azure Management Portal. Please open your website's dashboard and click on 'Reset Deployment Credentials' in the 'Quick Links' area.
